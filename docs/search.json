I’m currently an associate professor of political science and director of the security studies program at Kansas State University. My research focuses primarily on the political economy of states’ foreign policy behavior. My peer-reviewed research has appeared in the American Political Science Review, the British Journal of Political Science, International Studies Quarterly, and various other journals. I have also published several blog posts or op-eds in outlets like the Monkey Cage, The Conversation, and Political Violence @ a Glance. My research has also been featured in media outlets like The Economist, Al Jazeera, and Newsweek.\nI have recently finished a book project that focuses on the politics of US overseas military deployments. This is forthcoming with Oxford University Press and will be released in October of 2022 and is available for pre-order at Amazon.

    "text": "This page contains general information for students who are currently enrolled in, or who are interested in taking, my classes.\n\nGeneral Advice\nStudents often ask for advice on how to succeed in class. The following is a list of general tips and guidelines that may be useful to anyone taking any of my undergraduate or graduate courses.\n\nAttend class regularly. The most basic thing you can do to improve your performance is to attend class regularly, take good notes, and pay attention. Please note that I post all lecture slides online, so you do not need to copy each individual slide. Instead, try to focus on the overarching concepts or additional details that supplement the core points appearing on the slides. Also, please note that missing class for family events or other social activities does not exempt you from completing assigned material on time. While I realize that everyone values different aspects of their college experience in different ways, please understand that it is not my responsibility to accommodate the social schedules of every student. My job is to provide you with an opportunity to learn—whether or not you take advantage of that opportunity is up to you.\nDo the readings. As with attendance, another simple step you can take to improve performance is to keep up with the readings. Spend even a short amount of time each day with the material covered in class and in the assigned texts—spending 15 minutes per day reviewing material will be considerably more useful to you can 4 hours of cramming just before a test.\nAsk Questions. Don’t be afraid to ask questions. The whole reason you’re here is because you lack knowledge, not because you possess it. Whether it’s in class, after class, or during office hours, asking questions to clarify difficult material is a critical step.\nDocument special needs, disabilities, or illness early. I’m always happy to accommodate students with special needs, but please do not wait until the last week in the semester to inform me of something that has been systematically affecting your grade all semester. Please speak with the Student Access Center for more information.\n\n\n\nStudent Resources\nStudents deal with a lot. Aside from demanding class schedules, many students are also dealing with complicated personal lives, family issues, or working multiple jobs to make ends meet. This can take a toll on students, and many may be dealing with depression, anxiety, food insecurity, or other issues that can make it difficult to keep up in the classroom. The sheet below provides a variety of on-campus and off-campus resources for students.\n\nStudent Resource Sheet\n\n\n\nWriting Resources\n\nGoogle Scholar Instructions"

    "text": "Click the image to purchase!\nFrom the publisher:\nIn a time where US deployments are uncertain, this book shows how US service members can either build the necessary support to sustain their presence or create added animosity towards the military presence.\nThe United States stands at a crossroads in international security. The backbone of its international position for the last 70 years has been the massive network of overseas military deployments. However, the US now faces pressures to limit its overseas presence and spending. In Beyond the Wire, Michael Allen, Michael Flynn, Carla Martinez Machain, and Andrew Stravers argue that the US has entered into a “Domain of Competitive Consent” where the longevity of overseas deployments relies upon the buy-in from host-state populations and what other major powers offer in security guarantees. Drawing from three years of surveys and interviews across fourteen countries, they demonstrate that a key component of building support for the US mission is the service members themselves as they interact with local community members. Highlighting both the positive contact and economic benefits that flow from military deployments and the negative interactions like crime and anti-base protests, this book shows in the most rigorous and concrete way possible how US policy on the ground shapes its ability to advance its foreign policy goals.\n\n“This contemporary research rigorously details the many positive, and potentially negative, impacts of US military overseas deployments. It is rich in analysis and insight and an absolute must read for our US national security policy makers, so they more deeply understand how to best shape future military deployments. There is no doubt that Beyond the Wire will have a profound and lasting impact on our national security and foreign policy.”\n– Richard B. Myers, General, USAF, Ret., 15th Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and President Emeritus, Kansas State University\n\n“Beyond the Wire is the most ambitious study to date examining the politics of overseas U.S. military deployments. Drawing on an impressive fourteen country survey and in-depth interviews across three continents, the authors unpack when and how host nations give consent or resist U.S. military presence. Their findings carry deep implications for global hierarchy and the liberal international order.”\n– Andrew Yeo, SK-Korea Foundation Chair and Senior Fellow, Brookings Institution, and Professor of Politics, The Catholic University of America\n\n“Beyond the Wire offers an illuminating and innovative take on the topic of societal-military relations –in the authors’ case, on those between individual soldiers based overseas and the communities that host them. The book shows how the character of interactions between foreign military personnel and local citizens can have far reaching implications for international politics. In so doing, it moves civil-military relations research in new and exciting directions.”\n– Risa Brooks, Allis Chalmers Associate Professor of Political Science at Marquette University"
