THE BAHAMAS

On July 10, 1973, The Bahamas became an independent state. In a note dated July 10, 1973, to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, the Prime Minister made a statement reading in part as follows:
I have the honour, further to inform you that the Government of the Commonwealth of The Bahamas, conscious of the desirability of maintaining existing legal relationships, and conscious of its obligations under international law to honour its treaty commitments, acknowledges that many treaty rights and obligations of the Government of the United Kingdom in respect of The Bahamas were succeeded to by the Commonwealth of The Bahamas upon Independence by virtue of customary international law.
Since, however, it is likely that in virtue of customary international law certain treaties may have lapsed at the date of Independence of the Commonwealth of The Bahamas, it seems essential that each treaty should be subjected to legal examination. It is proposed, after this examination has been completed, to indicate which, if any, of the treaties which may have lapsed by customary international law the Government of the Commonwealth of The Bahamas wishes to treat as having lapsed.
It is desired that it be presumed that each treaty has been legally succeeded to by the Commonwealth of The Bahamas and that action be based on this presumption until a decision is reached that the treaty should be regarded as having lapsed. Should the Government of the Commonwealth of The Bahamas be of the opinion that it has legally succeeded to a treaty, and wishes to terminate the operation of the treaty, it will in due course give
 notice of termination in the terms thereof.

BARBADOS
On November 30, 1966, Barbados became an independent state. In a note dated February 10, 1967, to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, the Prime Minister and Minister of External Affairs made a statement reading in part as follows:
I have the honour to inform you that the Government of Barbados, conscious of the desirability of maintaining existing legal relationships, and conscious of its obligation under international law to honour its treaty commitments, acknowledges that many treaty rights and obligations of the Government of the United Kingdom in respect of Barbados were succeeded to by Barbados upon independence by virtue of customary international law.
2. Since, however, it is likely that by virtue of customary international law certain treaties may have lapsed at the date of independence of Barbados, it seems essential that each treaty should be subjected to legal examination. It is proposed after this examination has been completed, to indicate which, if any, of the treaties which may have lapsed by customary international law the Government of Barbados wishes to treat as having lapsed.
3. It is desired that it be presumed that each treaty has been legally succeeded to by Barbados and that action be based on this presumption until a decision is reached that it should be regarded as having lapsed. Should the Government of Barbados be of the opinion that it has legally succeeded to a treaty and wishes to terminate the operation of the treaty, it will in due course give notice of termination in the terms thereof.

BELIZE

On September 21, 1981, Belize became an independent state. In a letter dated September 29, 1982, to the Secretary General of the United Nations, the Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs of Belize made a statement reading in part as follows:
I have the honour to inform you that the Government of Belize has decided to continue to apply provisionally and on the basis of reciprocity, all treaties to which the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland was a party, the application of which was extended either expressly or by necessary implication to the then dependent territory of Belize.
Such provisional application would subsist until Belize otherwise notifies Your Excellency, the depository (in the case of a multilateral treaty), or the state party (in the case of a bilateral treaty.)
On October 14, 2009, the U.S. Department of State sent a diplomatic note to the Government of Belize which included a “list of multilateral treaties that continued to apply provisionally and on the basis of reciprocity between the United States and Belize upon Belize’s independence and thereafter…” as well as “a list of bilateral treaties and other international agreements that are carried on the records of the Department of State as being in force between the United States and Belize as of January 1,

BOTSWANA

On September 30, 1966, Bechuanaland Protectorate became the independent state of Botswana.
In a note dated October 6, 1966, to the Secretary-General of the United Nations the President of Botswana made a statement reading in part as follows:
As regards bilateral treaties validly concluded by the Government of the United Kingdom on behalf of the former Bechuanaland Protectorate, or validly applied or extended by the said Government to the territory of the former Bechuanaland Protectorate, the Government of Botswana is willing to continue to apply within its territory, on a basis of reciprocity, the terms of all such treaties for a period of twenty-four months from the date of independence (i.e., until October 1, 1968) unless abrogated or modified earlier by mutual consent. At the expiry of that period, the Government of Botswana will regard such of these treaties which could not by the application of the rules of customary international law be regarded as otherwise surviving, as having terminated.
It is the earnest hope of the Government of Botswana that during the aforementioned period of twenty-four months, the normal processes of diplomatic negotiations will enable it to reach satisfactory accord with the States concerned upon the possibility of the continuance or modification of such treaties.
The Government of Botswana is conscious that the above declaration applicable to bilateral treaties cannot with equal facility be applied to multilateral treaties. As regards these, therefore, the Government of Botswana proposes to review each of them individually and to indicate to the depositary in each case what steps it wishes to take in relation to each such instrument whether by way of confirmation of termination, confirmation of succession or accession. During such interim period of review any party to a multilateral treaty which has, prior to independence, been applied or extended to the former Bechuanaland Protectorate, may, on a basis of reciprocity, rely as against Botswana on the terms of such
 treaty.”

BRUNEI

On January 1, 1984, the former British protected state of Brunei gained full independence. In a letter dated January 1, 1984, to the Secretary General of the United Nations, the Sultan made a statement reading in part as follows:
“The Government of Brunei Darussalam recognises that it is desirable to maintain to the fullest extent compatible with the resumption by Brunei Darussalam of its status and emergence on 1st January 1984 as a fully independent and sovereign nation, legal continuity in treaty relations between Brunei Darussalam and other states. Accordingly, the Government of Brunei Darussalam makes the following declaration:
“1] As regards bilateral treaties validly concluded by the United Kingdom on behalf of Brunei Darussalam or validly applied or extended by the former to the latter, the Government of Brunei Darussalam is willing to accept, on a basis of reciprocity, the rights and obligations under the terms of all such treaties for a period of five years from 1st January 1984 until 31st December 1988 unless abrogated or modified earlier by mutual consent. At the expiry of that period, the Government of Brunei Darussalam will regard such of those treaties which could not by the application of the rules of customary international law be regarded as otherwise surviving, as having terminated.
“2] The Government of Brunei Darussalam acknowledges that the above declaration applicable to bilateral treaties cannot with equal facility be applied to multilateral treaties. As regards these, therefore, the Government of Brunei Darussalam proposes to examine each of them individually and to indicate to the depositary in each case what steps it wishes to take in relation to each such instrument — whether by confirmation of termination, confirmation of succession or accession.
During the period of examination the Government of Brunei Darussalam will on a basis of reciprocity accept all treaty rights and obligations accruing and arising under all multilateral treaties which were prior to
 independence validly applied or extended to Brunei Darussalam.”

In accordance with the Joint Declaration of the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and North Ireland and the Government of the People’s Republic of China on the Question of Hong Kong signed on 19 December 1984 (hereinafter referred to as the Joint Declaration), the People’s Republic of China will resume the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong with effect from 1 July 1997. Hong Kong will, with effect from that date, become a Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China.
It is provided in Section I of Annex I to the Joint Declaration, “Elaboration by the Government of the People’s Republic of China of its Basic Policies Regarding Hong Kong”, and in Articles 12, 13 and 14 of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China, which was adopted on 4 April 1990 by the National People’s

Congress of the People’s Republic of China (hereinafter referred to as the Basic law), that the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region will enjoy a high degree of autonomy, except in foreign and defence affairs which are the responsibility
of the Central People’s Government of the People’s Republic of China. Furthermore, it is provided both in Section XI of Annex I to the Joint Declaration and Article 153 of the Basic Law that international agreements to which the People’s Republic of China is not a party but which are implemented in Hong Kong may continue to be implemented in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.
In this connection, on behalf of the Government of the People’s Republic of China, I would like to inform Your Excellency as follows:
I. The treaties listed in Annex I [not printed herein] to this Note, to which the People’s Republic of China is a party, will be applied to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region with effect from 1 July 1997 as they:
(i) are applied to Hong Kong before 1 July 1997; or
(ii) fall within the category of foreign affairs or defence or, owing to their nature and provisions, must apply to the entire territory of a State; or
(iii) are not applied to Hong Kong before 1 July 1997 but with respect to which it has been decided to apply them to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region with effect from that date (denoted by an asterisk in Annex I.)
II. The treaties listed in Annex II [not printed herein] to this Note, to which the People’s Republic of China is not yet a party and which apply to Hong Kong before 1 July 1997, will continue to apply to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region with effect from 1 July 1997.
The provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights as applied to Hong Kong shall remain in force beginning from 1 July 1997....
III. The Government of the People’s Republic of China has already carried out separately the formalities required for the application of the treaties listed in the aforesaid Annexes, including all the related amendments, protocols, reservations and declarations, to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region with effect from 1 July 1997.
IV.

GUYANA

On May 26, 1966, Guyana (former British Guiana) became an independent state. In a letter dated June 30, 1966, to the Secretary General of the United Nations, the Prime Minister of Guyana made a statement reading in part as follows:
I have the honour to inform you that the Government of Guyana, conscious of the desirability of maintaining existing legal relationships, and conscious of its obligations under international law to honour its treaty commitments, acknowledges that many treaty rights and obligations of the Government of the United Kingdom in respect to British Guiana were succeeded to by Guyana upon independence by virtue of customary international law.
2. Since, however, it is likely that by virtue of customary international law certain treaties may have lapsed at the date of independence of Guyana, it seems essential that each treaty should be subjected to legal examination. It is proposed after this examination has been completed, to indicate which, if any, of the treaties which may have lapsed by customary international law the Government of Guyana wishes to treat as having lapsed.
3. As a result, the manner in which British Guiana was acquired by the British Crown, and its history previous to that date, consideration will have to be given to the question which, if any, treaties contracted previous to 1804 remain in force by virtue of customary international law.
4. It is desired that it be presumed that each treaty has been legally succeeded to by Guyana and that action be based on this presumption until a decision is reached that it should be regarded as having lapsed. Should the Government of Guyana be of the opinion that it has legally succeeded to a treaty and wishes to terminate the operation of the treaty, it will in due
 course give notice of termination in the terms thereof.

The Government of the Republic of Kiribati desires that questions of succession to such conventions, treaties and other international instruments be governed by accepted rules of international law and by the relevant principles contained in the Convention on Succession of States in respect of Treaties, done at Vienna on 23 August 1978. Accordingly, the Government of the Republic of Kiribati declares that, with regard to multi- lateral treaties applied or extended to the former Gilbert Islands it will continue to apply the terms of each such treaty provisionally and on the basis of reciprocity until such time as it notifies the depositary authority of its decision with respect thereto. With regard to bilateral treaties applied or extended to, or entered into on behalf of, the former Gilbert Islands, the Government of the Republic of Kiribati declares that it will examine each such treaty and communicate its views to the other State Party concerned. In the meantime the Government of the Republic of Kiribati will continue to observe the terms of each such treaty, which validly so applies and is not inconsistent with its advent to independence, provisionally and on a
 basis of reciprocity.

LESOTHO
In a note dated September 7, 1971, to the Secretary General of the United Nations, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Lesotho made a Declaration reading in part as follows:
Reference is made to the Declarations of the Government of the Kingdom of Lesotho in relation to its treaty relationships dated 22 March 1967 and 5 March 1969.
As regards bilateral treaties validly concluded by the Government of the United Kingdom on behalf of the country formerly known as Basutoland, or validly applied or extended by the said Government to the country known as Basutoland, the Government of the Kingdom of Lesotho, it will be recalled, willingly undertook to apply within its territory, on a basis of reciprocity, the terms of all such treaties from the date of Independence until October 4, 1970, unless abrogated or modified earlier by mutual consent. That time has now expired before it has been possible to evaluate all the treaties.
The Government of the Kingdom of Lesotho, mindful of the desirability of the continuity of treaty relationships consistent with its independent status, and desirous of continuing negotiations with the various States concerned in relation to the possible continuation, modification or termination of such treaties, has decided that the period during which it will apply, on a basis of reciprocity, the terms of such bilateral treaties shall be extended without limit of time, pending the reaching of a satisfactory accord with each State concerned.
Nothing in this Declaration shall, however, be held to constitute a succession to treaties which are not consistent with the accession to full sovereign status by the Kingdom of Lesotho, nor shall it be held to constitute an extension or renewal of treaties which, by virtue of their

termination clauses, have already expired or have been terminated before the date of this Declaration.
Under the terms of the Declaration of the Government of the Kingdom of Lesotho of 22 March 1967 it is not necessary to extend the period in relation to multilateral treaties. As represented in that Declaration, the Government of the Kingdom of Lesotho will review each of the multilateral treaties which has been applied or extended to the country formerly known as Basutoland and indicate to the depositary concerned what steps it desires to take in relation to such instrument.
During this period of review, as stated in the Declaration of 22 March 1967, any party to a multilateral treaty which has, prior to independence, been applied or extended to the country known as Basutoland, may, on a basis of reciprocity, rely as against Lesotho on the terms of such treaty, the Government of the Kingdom of Lesotho wishes it to be understood, as stated in its Declaration of 5 March 1969, that this is merely a transitional arrangement. Under no circumstances should it be implied that by these Declarations of Lesotho has either acceded to any particular treaty or
 indicated continuity of any particular treaty by way of succession.

By a note dated December 4, 1962, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Malagasy Republic informed the American Ambassador of the following (translation):
No official act specifies, in the agreements with the French Republic, the juridical position of the Malagasy Republic with regard to the rights and obligations contracted for Madagascar in the treaties, agreements, and conventions signed by France prior to Madagascar’s accession to international sovereignty. In accordance with usage, the Malagasy Republic considers itself implicitly bound by such texts unless it explicitly denounces them. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs informs the Embassy of the United States of America that, in order to avoid any ambiguity, the Malagasy Republic transmits, as soon as it is in a position to reach an affirmative decision on each of the texts in question, a formal declaration in which it declares itself bound by the Treaty, the Agreement or the
 Convention under consideration.

MAURITIUS

On March 12, 1968, Mauritius became an independent state. In a note dated March 12, 1968, to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, the Prime Minister and Minister of External Affairs made a statement reading in part as follows:
I have the honour to inform you that the Government of Mauritius, conscious of the desirability of maintaining existing legal relationships, and conscious of its obligation under international law to honour its treaty commitments, acknowledges that many treaty rights and obligations of the Government of the United Kingdom in respect of Mauritius were succeeded to by Mauritius upon independence by virtue of customary international law.
Since, however, it is likely that by virtue of customary international law certain treaties may have lapsed at the date of independence of Mauritius, it seems essential that each treaty should be subjected to legal examination. It is proposed after this examination has been completed, to indicate which, if any, of the treaties which may have lapsed by customary international law the Government of Mauritius wish to treat as having lapsed.
It is desired that it be presumed that each treaty has been legally succeeded to by Mauritius and that action be based upon this presumption until a decision is reached that it should be regarded as having lapsed. Should the Government of Mauritius be of the opinion that they have legally succeeded to a treaty but subsequently wish to terminate its operation, they
 will in due course give notice of termination in the terms thereof.

MICRONESIA
A letter of November 2, 1995, from the Government of the Federated States of Micronesia to the Secretary-General of the United Nations refers to a letter of May 22, 1992,
... containing a declaration setting out the position of the Government of the Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) with regard to international agreements entered into by the United States of America and made applicable to the FSM pursuant to the United Nations Trusteeship Agreement for the former Japanese Mandated Islands.
The Declaration stated that as to bilateral treaties validly concluded by the United States on behalf of the FSM, or validly applied or extended by the former to the latter before 3 November 1986, the Government of the FSM would examine each such treaty and communicate its views to the other State Party concerned. The Declaration also stated that the Government of the FSM would continue to observe the terms of each treaty which validly so applied and was not inconsistent with the letter or the spirit of the Constitution of the FSM, provisionally and on a basis of reciprocity. The period of examination was to extend until 3 November 1995, except in the case of any treaty in respect of which an earlier statement of views was or had been made. At the expiration of this period, the Government of the FSM would consider such of these treaties that could not by the

application of the rules of customary international law be regarded as otherwise surviving, as having terminated.
The letter of November 2, 1995, extends
... the period of examination of the bilateral treaties indicated above for two additional years, or until 3 November 1997.
With regard to multilateral treaties previously applied, the Declaration of 22 May 1992 stated that the Government of the FSM intends to review each of them individually and to communicate to the depositary in each case what steps it would take, whether by way of confirmation of termination or confirmation of succession or accession. During such period of review, any party to a multilateral treaty that had been validly applied or extended to the Federated States of Micronesia prior to 3 November 1986, and was not inconsistent with the letter or spirit of the Constitution of the FSM, may, on the basis of reciprocity, rely as against the FSM on the
 terms of such treaty.”

NAURU

On January 31, 1968, Nauru became an independent state. In a note dated May 28, 1968, to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, the Chief Secretary made a statement reading in part as follows:
Prior to Nauru attaining independence on 31st January, 1968, treaty relationships were entered into, on its behalf, by the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia. The Government of Nauru now wishes to make clear its position in regard to obligations arising from those treaties entered into prior to 31st January, 1968 by the Government of the Commonwealth of Australia, and accordingly makes the following declarations.
In respect of all bilateral treaties validly concluded by Australia on behalf of Nauru, or validly applied or extended by Australia to Nauru, before 31st January, 1968, the Government of Nauru will continue, on a basis of reciprocity, to apply the terms of such treaties for a period of twenty-four months unless such treaties are abrogated or modified earlier by agreement with the other contracting parties. At the expiration of this period the Government of Nauru will regard each such treaty as having terminated unless it has earlier agreed with the other contracting party to continue that treaty in existence.
It is the earnest hope of the Government of Nauru that during the aforementioned period of twenty-four months, the normal processes of diplomatic negotiations will enable it to reach satisfactory accord with the States concerned upon the possibility of the continuance or modification or termination of such treaties. In respect of multilateral treaties, the Government of Nauru intends to review each of them individually and to indicate to the depositary in each case what steps it wishes to take, whether by way of confirmation of succession, confirmation of termination or accession, in relation to each such instrument. During such period of review, any party to a multilateral treaty which was, prior to independence, validly applied or extended to Nauru may, on a basis of reciprocity, rely as against Nauru on the terms of the treaty.” In subsequent notes to the Secretary-General of the United Nations this period of review has been
 extended indefinitely.

On September 16, 1975, Papua New Guinea became an independent state. In a note dated September 16, 1975, to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, the Governor-General made a statement reading in part as follows:
1. The Government of Papua New Guinea will make an examination of all treaties applying to its territory before independence, both bilateral and multilateral, with a view to making a statement of intention in respect of each of them. The statement will declare the Government’s view as to whether the treaty continues or should be continued in force (on the basis of either succession or mutual consent, and with or without modification), or should be treated as having lapsed, or should be terminated. The statement will be forwarded to the other party or parties or to the depository, as may be appropriate.
2. During the period of examination, the Government will, on a basis of reciprocity, accept all treaty rights and obligations accruing and arising under treaties previously applicable. The period of examination will extend for five years from the date of Independence, that is, until 15th September, 1980, except in the case of any treaty in respect of which an earlier

SAINT KITTS AND NEVIS

On September 19, 1983, Saint Christopher and Nevis became an independent state. In a note dated November 2, 1983, to the Secretary- General of the United Nations, the Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs made a statement reading in part as follows:
I have the honor to refer to the attainment of in-dependence by the former British Associated State of St. Christopher and Nevis on 19th September, 1983, as Saint Christopher and Nevis or Saint Kitts and Nevis, and to the question of status of conventions, treaties and other international instruments applied to, or entered into on behalf of Saint Christopher and Nevis by the United Kingdom Government prior to independence.
The Government of Saint Christopher and Nevis considers that questions of succession to such conventions, treaties and other international instruments should be governed by the accepted rules of international law and by the relevant principles contained in the Convention on Succession of States in respect of Treaties done at Vienna on 23rd August, 1978.
The Government of Saint Christopher and Nevis hereby declares that, with regard to multilateral treaties applied or extended to the former British Associated State of Saint Christopher and Nevis, it will continue to apply the terms of each treaty provisionally and on the basis of reciprocity until such time as it notifies the depositary authority of its decision in respect thereof.
As regards bilateral treaties applied or extended to, or entered into on behalf of the former British Associated State of Saint Christopher and Nevis, the Government of Saint Christopher and Nevis declares that it will examine each such treaty and communicate its views to the other State Party concerned. In the mean-time, the Government of Saint Christopher and Nevis will continue to observe the terms of each treaty, which validly so applies and is not inconsistent with its independent sovereign status,
 provisionally and on basis of reciprocity.

Saint Lucia … is now ready to participate with other nations in fulfilling obligations under international law with respect to treaties to which this Government succeeded upon Independence.

Until this has been done the Government of Saint Lucia wish:

SAINT VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES

On October 27, 1979, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines became an independent state. In a note dated September 30, 1983, to the Secretary- General of the United Nations, the Prime Minister and Minister of Finance made a statement reading in part as follows:
I have the honour to refer to the attainment of independence by the former British Associated State of St. Vincent on 27th October, 1979, as the State of St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and to the question of status of convention, treaties and other international instruments applied to or entered into on behalf of St. Vincent by the United Kingdom Government prior to independence.
The Government of the State of St. Vincent and the Grenadines considers that questions of succession to such conventions, treaties and other international instruments should be governed by the accepted rules of international law and by the relevant principles contained in the Convention on Succession of States in respect of treaties done at Vienna on 23rd August, 1978.
The Government of the State of St. Vincent and the Grenadines hereby declares that, with regard to multilateral treaties applied or extended to the former British Associated State of St. Vincent, it will continue to apply the terms of each such treaty provisionally and on the basis of reciprocity until such time as it notifies the depository authority of its decision in respect thereof.
As regards bilateral treaties applied or extended to, or entered into on behalf of the former British Associated State of St. Vincent, the Government of the State of St. Vincent and the Grenadines declares that it will examine each such treaty and communicate its views to the other State Party concerned. In the meantime, the Government of the State of St.
Vincent and the Grenadines will continue to observe the terms of each such treaty, which validly so applies and is not inconsistent with its
 independent sovereign status, provisionally and on basis of reciprocity.

SURINAME

On November 25, 1975, Suriname became an independent state. In a note dated November 29, 1975, to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, the Prime Minister made a statement reading in part as follows:
The Government of the Republic of Surinam, conscious of the desirability of maintaining existing legal relationship, and conscious of its obligation under International Law to honour its treaty commitments, acknowledges that treaty rights and obligations of the Government of the Kingdom of the Netherlands in respect of Surinam were succeeded by the Republic of Surinam upon Independence by virtue of customary International Law.
Since, however, it is likely that by virtue of customary International Law certain treaties may have lapsed at the date of Independence of Surinam, it seems essential that each treaty should be subjected to legal examination. It is proposed after this examination has been completed, to indicate which, if any, of the treaties which may have lapsed by customary International Law the Government of the Republic of Surinam wish to treat as having lapsed.
It is desired that it be presumed that each treaty has been legally succeeded to by the Republic of Surinam and that action be based upon this presumption until a decision is reached that it should be regarded as having lapsed. Should the Government of the Republic of Surinam be of the opinion it has legally succeeded to a treaty but subsequently wish to terminate its operation, the Government will in due course give notice of
 termination in the terms thereof.

TUVALU

On October 1, 1978, Tuvalu became an independent state. In a note dated December 19, 1978, to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, the Prime Minister of Tuvalu made a statement reading in part as follows:
2 The Government of Tuvalu, conscious of the desirability of maintaining existing international legal relationships, and conscious of its obligations under international law to honour its treaty commitments, acknowledges that many treaty rights and obligations of the Government of the United Kingdom in respect of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Protectorate, the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony and Tuvalu were succeeded to by Tuvalu upon Independence by virtue of customary international law. Since, however, it is likely that by virtue of that law certain of such treaties may be said to have lapsed at the date of Tuvalu’s Independence, it seems essential that each treaty purporting or deemed to bind Tuvalu before that date should be subjected to legal examination. The Government of Tuvalu proposes after such examination has been completed to indicate which, if any, of the treaties which may be said to have lapsed by virtue of customary international law it proposes to treat as having lapsed.
3 The Government of Tuvalu desires that it should be presumed that each treaty purporting or deemed to bind Tuvalu before Independence has been legally succeeded to by Tuvalu and that action should be based on such presumption unless and until the Government of Tuvalu decides that any particular treaty should be treated as having lapsed. Should the Government of Tuvalu be of opinion that it has legally succeeded to any treaty, and wish to terminate the operation of such treaty, it will in due course give notice of termination in the terms thereof.
4 For the avoidance of doubt, the Government of Tuvalu further declares that it does not regard itself as bound by the terms of any convention creating an international organisation to the extent that such convention requires the payment of any sum by any State, by virtue only of the
 accession of the Government of the United Kingdom to such convention.”

ZAMBIA

On October 24, 1964, Zambia (former Northern Rhodesia) became an independent state. In a note dated September 1, 1965, to the Secretary General of the United Nations, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Zambia made a Declaration reading in part as follows:
I have the honour to inform you that the Government of Zambia, conscious of the desirability of maintaining existing legal relationships, and conscious of its obligations under international law to honour its treaty commitments acknowledges that many treaty rights and obligations of the Government of the United Kingdom in respect of Northern Rhodesia were succeeded to by Zambia upon independence by virtue of customary international law.
Since, however, it is likely that in virtue of customary international law certain treaties may have lapsed at the date of independence of Zambia, it seems essential that each treaty should be subjected to legal examination. It is proposed after this examination has been completed, to indicate which, if any, of the treaties which may have lapsed by customary international law the Government of Zambia wishes to treat as having lapsed.
The question of Zambia’s succession to treaties is complicated by legal questions arising from the entrustment of external affairs powers to the former Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. Until these questions have been resolved it will remain unclear to what extent Zambia remains affected by the treaties contracted by the former Federation.
It is desired that it be presumed that each treaty has been legally succeeded to by Zambia and that action be based on this presumption until a decision is reached that it should be regarded as having lapsed. Should the Government of Zambia be of the opinion that it has legally succeeded to a treaty, and wishes to terminate the operation of the treaty, it will in due
 course give notice of termination in the terms thereof.

its territory all such bilateral treaties until the 18th April 1985, unless terminated earlier or modified by mutual consent. Thereafter my Government will regard those treaties whose continuance or modification has not been agreed upon as having terminated.”
In a further letter to the Secretary-General, received February 20, 1985, the Prime Minister stated in part:
During the past four years my Government has re-viewed all such bilateral treaties as were available to it or were brought to its attention and has also concluded a number of bilateral treaties with other governments with the effect that these instruments have superseded some of the earlier ones. It has become evident to my Government that many contracting parties prefer to enter into new arrangements with my Government rather than revive those treaties whose operations might have been suspended or terminated between 1965 and 1979 or which are now considered to be obsolete in the conduct of present-day international relations.
Whilst it has not been practicable for my Government to re-negotiate and finalise all such agreements on which a willingness to keep and maintain them in force was mutually indicated by my Government and other contracting parties, my Government has reached the stage at which it considers that legal continuity between itself and Other Contracting States has been achieved with an understanding either to revive, modify, renegotiate, terminate or adopt such bilateral treaties and, accordingly, my Government now wishes to inform Your Excellency, and through you all Member States of the United Nations Organisation as follows:
All bilateral treaties that were validly concluded or recognised by the United Kingdom Government in respect of Southern Rhodesia and continued to be applied and respected by my Government pursuant to the declaration aforementioned will now expire on 18 April 1985, UNLESS:
(i) Either my Government has already communicated to the other contracting party its intention to maintain the continuance in force of the treaty or the process of re-negotiating its terms and provisions has been
(i) 
		agreed upon; or

On April 18, 1980, Zimbabwe became an independent state. In a note dated February 24, 1981, to the Secretary General of the United Nations, the Prime Minister made a statement reading in part as follows:
My Government will continue to apply within its territory, on the basis of the principles of reciprocity and mutual respect for sovereign independence, all
bilateral treaties validly concluded or recognised by the United Kingdom Government in respect of Southern Rhodesia for a period of three years from the date of independence, i.e. 18th April, 1980, unless such treaties are terminated or modified earlier by mutual consent. It is the intention of my Government during such period to subject all bilateral treaties to full examination for the purpose of determining whether such treaties require termination, revision or renegotiation in the light of Zimbabwe’s sovereign status. It is the earnest hope of my Government that during the aforementioned period the normal processes of diplomatic negotiation will enable it to reach satisfactory accord with the States concerned upon the possibility of the continuance, modification or termination of such treaties.
At the end of the three year period referred to above my Government will regard such treaties whose continuance or modification have not been agreed as having terminated.
As regards multilateral treaties validly concluded or recognised by the United Kingdom Government in respect of Southern Rhodesia, my Government pro-poses to review at least some of those treaties during a period of six years from the date of independence, i.e. 18th April, 1980. It will indicate to the depositaries in each case of review whether the Republic of Zimbabwe will confirm, seek to modify or terminate its obligations under the treaty concerned. During such period of review any party to a multilateral treaty which was validly applied or extended to Southern Rhodesia may, on the basis of reciprocity and respect for national independence, rely on the terms of such treaty until it is modified or terminated. At the expiration of the period of review treaties as modified, or which have not been terminated, shall continue fully in force as if they had been concluded by the Republic of Zimbabwe.
By note of April 14, 1983, to the Secretary-General of the United Nations, the Government of Zimbabwe extended the period of review of bilateral treaties to April 18, 1984. This period of review was further extended by a note dated April 11, 1984, in which the Prime Minister notified the Secretary-General that “… my Government will continue to apply within
(ii) 
The other contracting party notifies my Government before 18 April 1985 through normal diplomatic channels of its intention either to keep and maintain the continuance in force of the treaty concerned or to renegotiate its terms and provisions, in which case, my Government will consider itself bound by that Treaty.
The United States presented Zimbabwe by diplomatic note of April 17, 1985, a list of international agreements which the Government of the
 United States intended to maintain in force.
